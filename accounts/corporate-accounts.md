# Hachyderm Corporate Covenant

 - Corporate Hachyderm accounts **are by invitation only.**
 - All corporate accounts must self-identify by placing their full legal corporation name as their display name.

#### How do I get my company invited?

> If you are interested in a corporate account on Hachyderm you will need to reach out directly to Kris Nóva. You can email her directly at `nova@hachyderm.io`.

> Managing expectations, we intend to have a very small amount of corporate accounts. There is no guarantee your account will be accepted.

> If you have been asked to remove your corporate account we ask you to be patient with us as we are currently trying to balance our community as we introduce trust with corporations.

A part of getting an invitation will be having a strong track record and getting it on Kris Nóva's radar.
By sharing your existing social media accounts, personas, and content we can get a feel for if we believe you will be a strong addition to the carefully guarded hachyderm community.

## Covenant Guiding Principles 

If you have been invited to have a Hachyderm corporate account we ask that you understand and adhere to our guiding principles. 

### 1. Be a Hachydermian: Fines Doubled In Work Zone

We expect you to set the bar for what it means to be a Hachydermian, and the rules apply extra to you.

> I agree to be a steward and role model in the Hachyderm community. I understand that my presence as a corporation implies the rules will be more strictly applied to me than normal accounts.

The Hachyderm community is a diverse community composed of many people with many economic beliefs and diverse backgrounds.

We expect you to have a mature understanding of various economic structures around the world and understand the power and responsibility that you have as a corporation to this community.

In the Hachyderm community you will find strong capitalists and anti-capitalists.
We expect you to consider these different perspectives while creating content on Hachyderm. 

As a corporate Hachydermian [our rules](https://Hachyderm.io/about/more#rules) apply more to you than to the normal user.
Which means the consequences of a rule violation applies more to you than others. 
In other words, your fines will be doubled if you end up violating our rules.
We will warn you first that you have violated a guiding principle, and if it continues, we will ask you to leave.

Ultimately you are setting the bar both for Hachyderm users as well as the other corporate accounts with this exclusive privilege.

### 2. Be The Corporation You Want To Work With

We expect you to do unto the community as you would have done unto you.

"Create the market you would want to shop at."

> I agree to build a market that I would want to shop at. I agree to set the bar for having world-class corporate engagement in Hachyderm.

We find value in drawing the analogy to forced advertising at the gas station.

As a gas station owner, forced messaging makes sense because of the higher return on advertising.
As a gas station customer, there is nothing more annoying than being forced to listen to an ad while pumping gas.

We want people to want to shop at your gas station, which means you need to consider their experience first.

We have high expectations for our community filling their cars with your metaphorical gas.

### 3. Say It Once: The "Wikipedia" policy

Measuring spam is hard. We expect you to stay away from repetitive content.

> I agree to share only new content and avoid repetitive content. I understand that words can be changed but messaging can remain consistent. I agree to only share my content once.

We don't have time to chase you around.

We find value in what Wikipedia calls [Use our own words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Use_our_own_words).

> The best practice is to research the most reliable sources on the topic and summarize what they say in your own words.

We understand that while technically not repeating the exact same words you can deliver the same message. 
We expect you to say your message once, and not repeat the same message time and time again.

We are explicitly trying to avoid the "cron job" effect that we see on Twitter with promotional accounts.
When in doubt, craft new words and distinguish new material from what you've said in the past; fill in gaps and create more of a story rather than rehash what you've already said. Otherwise it likely is repetitive content.

In short we hold you to a high bar to be "the first of your kind"; otherwise we expect you to be contributing to the existing resource when applicable. 

We don't want Hachyderm to turn into a promotional recycling center. You are either sharing new content or you are mentioning the original source and adding to it.

### 4. "We Know It When We See It" Policy

Ultimately the community comes first, and the communities response to your corporate content will be our guiding light. 

> I understand that policies are difficult to enforce. If it is made obvious to me that Hachyderm is no longer benefiting from my presence I will politely and promptly close my account or and move to another server.

If your content becomes invasive or unwanted, as defined by the consensus of our community and determined in our discretion, or seems to be giving rise to problems, we will ask you to move your corporate account to another server.

Basically we look at bad actors like we look at pornography. We know it when we see it. You agree to leave if any moderator (as designated by @nova) asks you to leave at any time.

### 5. Mods are Volunteers, Not Product Marketing Police

The corporate account needs to be a win for everyone involved, including our moderators. 

> I understand that it is my job to self-moderate. If moderation from Hachyderm is involved we have failed twice. First in self-moderation, and second in violating a specific policy.

A corporate account should be helping to keep bad actors out while also setting a high bar of what it means to be a good community member. 

If at any time the effort that Hachyderm moderators are spending moderating your content outweighs the benefit that the community receives from your presence, it's time to go.

Our moderators are here to keep the community safe, not police your product marketing.
